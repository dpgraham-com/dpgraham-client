# dpgraham-client

## Introduction

Welcome to the `dpgraham-client` repository, this repository contains a React single-page application (SPA)
that serves as my personal blog and experimental website. This application accompanies
the [`dpgraham-server`](https://github.com/dpgraham4401/dpgraham-server) repo.

## Purpose

If you're reading this, you probably think I'm crazy. I understand that using a single-page application is not
the most economical way to create a personal blog, I have intentionally chosen this approach as an opportunity to
explore and learn about various aspects of web
development. By developing this project, I aim to gain hands-on experience with React, TypeScript, and other front end
related technologies.
